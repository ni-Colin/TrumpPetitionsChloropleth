#Cholorpleth (Coloured Map) from comparison of two UK Govt petitions

This is a project in R to generate a colour coded map using info from petitions for and against a Trump state visit to determine how much support he has across different regions of the UK

It uses json data from the petitions themselves.  Colour coding indicates how much the For/Against ratio is below (blue) or above (red) the overall ratio.

Basically blue means less support for Trump, Red means more.
